## Why another course?

There are already so many blockchain courses then why do we need another
course?  The reason are
  1. There are definitely some basic courses, but there are only a few courses that cover advanced Developer Concepts & Tools, DeFi, or NFT topics.
  2. We want to cover all the advanced topics in DoDAO and to be able to write advanced courses, we need to have basic information/courses in place
     first.
  3. Once done with basic topics, we will work on the advanced topics.
  4. DoDAO is an onboarding platform, i.e. we educate the users about various projects. Understanding these blockchain projects needs a lot of basic blockchain knowledge.
     These courses can then be reused when we develop onboarding content for various projects.      
Note - We would want our courses to be completely free for everyone
and forever.

## How are our Courses different?

There are many video courses, but these is less focus on creating summarized
content and on creating questions bank. So our focus is to reuse the videos
from youtube, but create high quality summaries and question banks.There were
couple of suggestions which we will also include
1. Create mind maps - Suggestion by Lakshya. This can be done after we are done with all the chapters. We will
create mind map for each chapter and this will be paid work.
2. Incentivize course completion - Allow users to download all the mind-maps once they complete
the full course. This was recommended by Raghav
3. Assignments and Solutions
    - Add 2-4 assignments for each chapter with the solutions.4. Video Annotations
    - Annotating the Youtube Videos with relevant timestamps and questions. We will allow skipping of parts of the video and also show questions on top of videos

Note: Please recommend at least one idea in the #discussions channel under courses

- [x]  There are no question banks to evaluate the knowledge gained

## What is included in a course?

Our basic courses will consist of 6-10 chapters and in each chapter we
will cover
1. Readings - we call it readings, but this is the list of videos one can watch on Youtube to know about the topic. We should capture max of 3-4
videos for each chapter.
2. Summaries - This is a list of sub-topics in a chapter which we will summarize. Intent is the user can revise each and every concept
in the chapter by going through the bullet points. Please look at \"Two Minute Drill\" sections in SCJP book ([https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf](https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf))
3. Questions - About 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions for each chapter. We want to write max 2-3 true/false questions. Almost in all cases
the question should have at least 4 choices.

## Contributing

Currently contributing to courses involves working on a chapter which
has \"two\" tasks
1. Readings and Summaries - Create yaml file with details of readings and summaries for that chapter. e.g. [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml)
2. Questions - Create 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions for the  chapter you are working on. e.g. [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml). Later
  on we will add another task i.e. creating of the mind maps for each chapter, but
  for now its not needed. Also make sure that your name is added on a Trello card corresponding to the task you are working on.
