There are definitely some basic courses, but there are only a few courses that cover advanced Developer Concepts & Tools, DeFi, or NFT topics.\n  2. We want to cover all the advanced topics in DoDAO and to be able to write advanced courses, we need to have basic information/courses in place\n     first.\n  3. Once done with basic topics, we will work on the advanced topics.\n  4. DoDAO is an onboarding platform, i.e. we educate the users about various projects. Understanding these blockchain projects needs a lot of basic blockchain knowledge.\n     These courses can then be reused when we develop onboarding content for various projects.      \nNote - We would want our courses to be completely free for everyone\nand forever.\n",

Create mind maps - Suggestion by Lakshya. This can be done after we are done with all the chapters. We will\ncreate mind map for each chapter and this will be paid work.\n2. Incentivize course completion - Allow users to download all the mind-maps once they complete\nthe full course. This was recommended by Raghav\n3. Assignments and Solutions\n    - Add 2-4 assignments for each chapter with the solutions.4. Video Annotations\n    - Annotating the Youtube Videos with relevant timestamps and questions. We will allow skipping of parts of the video and also show questions on top of videos\n\nNote: Please recommend at least one idea in the #discussions channel under courses\n",
