      There are already so many blockchain courses then why do we need another
      course? \n\n The reason are\n\n1. There are definitely some basic courses, but
      there are only a few courses that cover advanced Developer Concepts & Tools, DeFi,
      or NFT topics.\n2. We want to cover all the advanced topics in DoDAO and to be
      able to write advanced courses, we need to have basic information/courses in place
      first.\n3. Once done with basic topics, we will work on the advanced topics.\n4.
      DoDAO is an onboarding platform, i.e. we educate the users about various projects.
      Understanding these blockchain projects needs a lot of basic blockchain knowledge.
      These courses can then be reused when we develop onboarding content for various
      projects.\n \n Note - We would want our courses to be completely free for everyone
      and forever.

      "There are many video courses, but these is less focus on creating summarized
      content and on creating questions bank. \n\nSo our focus is to reuse the videos
      from youtube, but create high quality summaries and question banks.\n\nThere were
      couple of suggestions which we will also include\n\n1. Create mind maps - Suggestion
      by Lakshya. This can be done after we are done with all the chapters. We will
      create mind map for each chapter and this will be paid work.\n\n2. Incentivize
      course completion - Allow users to download all the mind-maps once they complete
      the full course. This was recommended by Raghav\n\n3. Assignments and Solutions
      - Add 2-4 assignments for each chapter with the solutions.\n\n4. Video Annotations
      - Annotating the Youtube Videos with relevant timestamps and questions. We will
      allow skipping of parts of the video and also show questions on top of videos
      \n\nNote: Please recommend at least one idea in the #discussions channel under
      courses\n"

      "Our basic courses will consist of 6-10 chapters and in each chapter we
      will cover\n\n1. Readings - we call it readings, but this is the list of videos
      one can watch on Youtube to know about the topic. We should capture max of 3-4
      videos for each chapter.\n2. Summaries - This is a list of sub-topics in a chapter
      which we will summarize. Intent is the user can revise each and every concept
      in the chapter by going through the bullet points. Please look at \"Two Minute
      Drill\" sections in SCJP book ([https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf](https://firozstar.tripod.com/_darksiderg.pdf))
      \n3. Questions - About 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions for
      each chapter. We want to write max 2-3 true/false questions. Almost in all cases
      the question should have at least 4 choices."

      "Currently contributing to courses involves working on a chapter which
      has \"two\" tasks\n1. Readings and Summaries - Create yaml file with details of
      readings and summaries for that chapter. e.g. [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/summaries/data_types.yaml)\n2.
      Questions - Create 50 high quality single or multiple choice questions for the
      chapter you are working on. e.g. [https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml](https://github.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-solidity-course/blob/main/src/questions/data_types.yaml)\n\nLater
      on we will add another task i.e. creating of the mind maps for each chapter, but
      for now its not needed. \n\nAlso make sure that your name is added on a Trello
      card corresponding to the task you are working on."
